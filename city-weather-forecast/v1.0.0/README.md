This city weather forecast generator was created using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. It utilizes Open Weather Map's free API subscription to fetch weather data and create pre-made widgets. These widgets provide a weekly overview and current details on the weather in a given city. It also implements Leaflet to add a dynamic map feature with various weather layer options. 

The HTML for this project is fairly simple. I utilize many divisions for different items, feature buttons and drop-down menus, and include functions for the HTML to work with my JavaScript file. 

The CSS for this project utilizes the flex box layout. It focuses heavily on proper spacing and layout. I also add animations for objects to smoothly load onto the page. I also added responsive media sizing to account for different screen sizes.

The JavaScript for this project features fetching data via an API from Open Weather Map. From that data, I can assign variables to the data I need and properly load the data. It also implements much code straight from Open Weather Map and Leaflet's documentation to load widgets and maps. 

Additional commentary can be found inside the code files in this repository.
