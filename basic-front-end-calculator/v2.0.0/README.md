## v2.0.0 Description

This responsive web calculator supports basic arithmetic, decimal, and unary operations. It utilizes the jQuery library to simplify DOM manipulation and easily update the calculator display. However, the logic for this project is different from most calculators. Instead of using an evaluate function to simply solve a complex expression, I opted to utilize JavaScript logic with many variables and functions. This allows for automatic calculations, where some expressions are solved immediately after being entered in. This makes for an application that functions like a pre-iOS calculator. 

## v2.0.0 File Structure

The HTML for this project contains semantic HTML that coordinates with the script.js file. 

The CSS for this project contains organized styles that ensure a clean, responsive UI. It also contains responsive media that allows this project to adapt to any screen size. 

The JavaScript for this project contains logic to handle input, perform operations, and update the display with the jQuery library. It also contains keyboard listeners to support keyboard input from the user.
