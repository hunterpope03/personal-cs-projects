# Basic-Front-End-Calculator

This basic front-end calculator was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including the jQuery library). It functions similarly to the pre-iOS 18 calculator, offering automatic calculations where certain expressions are instantly evaluated upon being entered. It supports basic arithmetic, unary, and decimal operations with a responsive user-interface. I utilized jQuery heavily to simplify DOM manipulation, creating a smooth-flowing experience for any user. 

The HTML structure for this project is extremely simple. I follow a semantic structure, making divisions for each row of the calculator. 

The CSS for this project utilizes a simple grid layout with large, easy-to-read buttons. It focuses heavily on responsive button styling that visual adds visual feedback. I also added responsive media sizing to account for different screen sizes. 

The JavaScript for this project utilizes the jQuery libarary to take input, process the operation, and seamlessly update the display in real-time. The logic ensures automatic calculations for certain expressions, mimicking the behavior of the pre-iOS 18 calculator.
